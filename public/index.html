            <h1 id="about-us">About Us</h1>
<p>The <strong>Digital Forge Team</strong> is a collection of 25 talented individuals that have
worked together over the past 5 years to put together some amazing technology for
their parent company.  In 2022, our parent company elected to shut down this
unique experiment and offshore the work.  This website documents our public 
work, our collaborative and caring culture, and our innovative and energized spirit.<br />
It is our hope that you find great people here that would fit in your own organization 
and help you forge the future.</p>
<h1 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h1>
<p>Digitize an industrial engineering company by infusing products and services with
digital technology.  This required working in highly regulated industries (such as 
medical, and energy), and required high quality engineering with meticulous attention
to detail, robust and cyber-secure solutions, and an agile approach.</p>
<h1 id="our-origin">Our Origin</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>To support our ambitions, we opened
our first Digital Forge in the San
Francisco Bay area in FY2018, designed
to accelerate our digital projects and
provide a co-innovation space for us,
our customers and other partners.
We also held workshops throughout
the year to drive innovative thinking,
identify and develop solutions for future
problems, and collaborate on forward
thinking technologies </p>

<p>From the Smiths Annual Report 2021: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smiths Digital Forge
Our Digital Forge centre of excellence
opened in 2018 and is accelerating the
growth of digitally connected products in
our portfolio and driving efficiency and
speed through common development
and common platforms and tools that
can be repurposed across multiple
Smiths product lines. The Digital Forge
is sponsored by our Chief Executive and
the Smiths Digital Advisory Committee
(comprising members of the Smiths
Executive Committee) determines its
strategy and governs our digital activities.</p>
<p>The Forge is predominantly focused
on developing interface solutions that
digitise products by connecting them to
the internet/cloud and enabling the flow
of data and relevant analytics with a high
degree of cyber security. The Forge is also
able to support continuous improvement in
processes in our divisions with capabilities
in automation, robotics and the use of
Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>John Crane SenseTM condition-based
seal monitoring technology is connected
by a digital interface developed by the
Forge. Products being developed under
the methane detection programme are
also driven by technology developed by
the Forge, which will enable methane
sensors to be deployed anywhere, without
the need for a power source or cellular
communication link.</p>

<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-team">Artificial Intelligence Team</h2>
<p>A dynamic group of scientists and engineers that applied their skills to the problems of 
modelling complex data coming from assets in the oil and gas industry.  For the details

<li>real time visualization</li>
<li>physics-based models</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hardware-team">Hardware Team</h2>
<p>Much of the digital technology at the Forge required a physical hardware component.  Whether
this was packaging and integration of sensors, custom data acquisition systems, PCBs or 
thermal management for embedded compute devices, this team handled it all, along with
testing and customer support.  For the details on the hardware team, click <a href="http://forge-on.com/teams/hardware/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="software-team">Software Team</h2>
<p>The software team covered the full stack, starting at the device level in embedded devices, and 
provided the software technology to bring the data all the way to the cloud for analysis and
review in a standard web browser.  They also handled the automated build, regression testing,
software process, and general architecture of the products being developed at the Forge.

<h1 id="our-accomplishments">Our Accomplishments</h1>
<p>Much of what the Forge worked on remains proprietary to the parent company.  However, there are a couple of
projects that have a public presence, and we can provide some details on those.</p>
<h2 id="john-crane-sense">John Crane Sense</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>John Crane’s long experience in preventing and 
remediating leaks will enable us 
to play a leading role in customer decarbonisation
through our methane initiative.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Methane is the most potent current
contributor to global warming. With the oil
&amp; gas sector set to continue playing a key
role in the energy supply chain, reducing
methane emissions is a critical step
towards Net Zero. Pursuing all mitigation
measures now could slow the rate of near
term global warming by as much as 30%,
potentially reducing total warming by a half
degree by the end of the century.
Systematic measuring, mitigation and
monitoring to limit methane emissions
will be required by the sector to meet
decarbonisation goals.</p>
<p>Working with the Smiths <em>Digital Forge</em>,
John Crane is developing technology and
services to meet this need, which can be
deployed across a range of environments
from pipelines and plants to offshore rigs,
in order to provide data to customers that
will enable them to monitor methane leaks
from sources over time and take corrective
action. Multiple solutions are being
developed to enable affordable technology
and the ability to detect methane leaks in
remote and hazardous locations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Our Digital Forge centre of excellence
in the San Francisco Bay area, opened
in 2018, is accelerating digital projects
and providing a co-innovation space for
us, our customers and other partners.
John Crane Sense™ is one example of
the collaboration between the Digital
Forge and John Crane.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sense is a platform utilising sensors
and software that allow customers to
optimise performance and improve
reliability. Working with John Crane
experts, the Digital Forge has
developed sophisticated machine
learning algorithms that monitor seal
performance, diagnose root causes
of equipment issues, and predict and
prevent potential failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John Crane experts build sensors into
seals and integrate sensors with the
surrounding equipment to capture
critical data. The Digital Forge developed
the technical infrastructure to move
this data to a highly secure cloud-based
server where it is processed using the
latest algorithms and then stored for
visualisation and continuous analysis
over the life of the asset. Customers can
also access all of their own unique
information and gain valuable insights
via this secure web browser based solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our innovation framework is enabling
increased collaboration such as this
across Smiths and extends to external
partnerships. In FY2019 we entered
into new partnerships with leading
universities to help share ideas and
create innovations for the future.</p>

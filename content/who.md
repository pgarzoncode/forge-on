# The Forge Teams

## Artificial Intelligence Team

A dynamic group of scientists and engineers that applied their skills to the problems of 
modelling complex data coming from assets in the oil and gas industry.  For the details
on that team, click [here](@/teams/ai/index.md).

## Hardware Team

Much of the digital technology at the Forge required a physical hardware component.  Whether
this was packaging and integration of sensors, custom data acquisition systems, PCBs or 
thermal management for embedded compute devices, this team handled it all, along with
testing and customer support.  For the details on the hardware team, click [here](@/teams/hardware/index.md).

## Software Team

The software team covered the full stack, starting at the device level in embedded devices, and 
provided the software technology to bring the data all the way to the cloud for analysis and
review in a standard web browser.  They also handled the automated build, regression testing,
software process, and general architecture of the products being developed at the Forge.

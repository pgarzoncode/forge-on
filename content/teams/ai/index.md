# Mission
The AI team at Smiths Forge develops bespoke algorithms and user interfaces to Smiths product 
offerings either through new digital products or as enhancements to existing products. For the 
last two years the team has been almost exclusively devoted to John Crane Sense™, which is 
a monitoring solution for critical industrial assets with mechanical seals such as pumps and 
compressors. From all the sensor data continuously arriving in the cloud we aim to re-create 
the industrial context for the data via a digital twin-like UI, continuously analyzing the 
streams of data to detect adverse conditions before they cause damage to assets or operations, 
and alert operators via email and SMS.

## Sondre Skatter - Chief AI Scientist
{{photo(id="sondre.jpg")}}
In his current role as Chief Algorithm Scientist in Smiths Digital Forge Sondre Skatter is 
responsible for introducing cutting-edge algorithms into Smiths Group product offerings and 
in driving Smiths’ digitization initiative. Whether based on Machine Learning, or physics 
and models, the algorithms seek to squeeze more performance and functionality out of existing 
Smiths products, as well as imagine new product ideas. Sondre Skatter got his master's in physics 
at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 1994 and a PhD in at Norwegian University 
of Life Sciences in 1998. He has mainly worked in the field of explosive detection across multiple 
technologies applying physics and algorithms to improve performance of these systems. 

Sondre has 15+ patents issued and 11 papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Sondre has 
three daughters, a ridgeback, and loves rock climbing, trail running and playing music in various 
bands and jam sessions.

## Ryan Quadri - AI Scientist
{{photo(id="ryan.jpg")}}
As an AI scientist at the Smiths Digital Forge, Ryan focuses on algorithm development — including 
machine learning and physics-based modeling — and diving deeply into complex datasets. In addition 
to his work on John Crane Sense, Ryan has developed software and algorithms to extract information 
from engineering diagrams and to statistically optimize the inventory holdings of spare parts. He 
has also worked with John Crane manufacturing to measure the efficiency of their manufacturing 
capabilities and to produce forecasts of how customer demand varies across geographical region, 
season, product line.

Ryan’s background is in astrophysics, with a specialty in the field of galaxy evolution. After 
completing his Ph.D. he held a number of research fellowships before joining the faculty at Texas 
A&M University where he taught, supervised Ph.D. students, and helped lead the extragalactic 
research group.

## Xiao Han - AI Scientist
{{photo(id="xiao.jpg")}}
Xiao joined the Forge in 2019 after receiving her master’s degree in Data Science from the 
University of San Francisco and has grown into the AI team’s own full stack scientist/engineer 
in the past 3 years. She’s worked on projects ranging from architecting and building an 
end-to-end data processing tool with Python and PostgreSQL, developing algorithms combining 
classical methods and machine learning algorithms for highly regulated industries, building 
REST APIs, and creating customized user interfaces for the Sense product using React and 
Typescript. She’s particularly passionate for conquering challenges and discovering 
innovative ways to convey the beauty of data science to more people. 

When not at work, she enjoys challenging herself both mentally and physically in CrossFit 
and Olympic weightlifting, as well as exploring the nature with her dog Relu, our part-time 
office therapist.

Skills

* Software development (Python)
* User interface design and development for data-facing products and applications 
  (JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Redux)
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* Databases (SQL, MongoDB)

## Laurel Haskins - AI Scientist
{{photo(id="laurel.jpg")}}
At Smiths Digital Forge, Laurel designed and implemented algorithms and processes in support of the
group’s mission. She made critical contributions to the architecture of the core application 
framework, developing the data science team’s underlying app configuration and asset data management
systems. She enjoys problem solving with team members and building tools to enhance their productivity.

Laurel received her PhD in theoretical particle physics from UC Santa Cruz in 2017, and continued 
her work on dark matter model-building and phenomenology at the Racah Institute in Jerusalem. 
In 2019, Laurel’s desire to turn her mathematical skills toward more tangible problem-solving 
catalyzed her transition from post-doctoral work into machine learning and data science.

## Samuel Heppelmann - AI Scientist
{{photo(id="sam.jpg")}}
Sam joined the Forge as an AI Scientist at the start of 2022. He has worked on model development 
of several processes such as PID control algorithms and gas plume detection schemes, in addition 
to helping maintain the data team’s Sense platform. His interests include statistical analysis, 
experimental design, green technology, and computer vision.

Sam has a background in experimental physics with a focus in relativistic nuclear collisions. 
In 2021, he finished his PhD at UC Davis and published his thesis on the statistical moments of 
heavy-ion collisions.

## Spencer Harrison - Data Engineer
{{photo(id="spencer.jpg")}}
Spencer is a data engineer at the Digital Forge, developing and maintaining business tools hosted 
in the cloud. He focuses on pipelines and monitors, specializing in manufacturing, shipping, and 
industry. He works closely with the data science team at the Forge, providing standalone tools that 
integrate with the existing infrastructure. He extended the functionality of a watchdog system to 
track and report uptime and failure modes for edge devices, cloud service lapses, and faults in 
applications. In the past he has worked on tools for shipping and order fulfillment, providing the 
digital infrastructure to provide fulfillment costs competing with major companies. 

Spencer has a BA in Mathematics from UC Davis, an MS in Applied Mathematics from SDSU, and he is
working on an MS in Data Science from UT Austin. Spencer is currently interviewing for data engineer 
positions, but he would like to remain a part of the Digital Forge.

# Events
The AI/Data Science team has organized events and challenges across the Smiths organization to foster creativity, builder culture, competition, and collaboration across business units. We also like to get together every few months for a hike. Here is a picture from one of them in the Oakland hills.

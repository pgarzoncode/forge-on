# Mission / Description
 
The Hardware team at Smiths Digital Forge consists of the Design, Test, and Certification sub-teams. Our team focuses on integrating digital technologies into Smiths Group divisions' current and next-generation products. During the development process, the design team collaborates with the different Engineering groups to digitally enable products with technologies such as sensors, computing, radios, displays, etc. In addition, our integration and testing team works closely with product managers to ensure functionality and feature completeness while providing user documentation and reports. Lastly, the team works with recognized labs to ensure designs are tested/validated for their industry 
requirements.

The hardware team constantly champions an iterative process that allows a shorter time to market and utilizes customer feedback to help guide the design and product definitionâ€”fostering digital transformation and innovation within Smiths.

# About Us

The **Digital Forge Team** is a collection of 25 talented individuals that have
worked together over the past 5 years to put together some amazing technology for
their parent company.  In 2022, our parent company elected to shut down this
unique experiment and offshore the work.  This website documents our public 
work, our collaborative and caring culture, and our innovative and energized spirit.  
It is our hope that you find great people here that would fit in your own organization 
and help you forge the future.

# Our Mission

Digitize an industrial engineering company by infusing products and services with
digital technology.  This required working in highly regulated industries (such as 
medical, and energy), and required high quality engineering with meticulous attention
to detail, robust and cyber-secure solutions, and an agile approach.

# Our Origin

>To support our ambitions, we opened
>our first Digital Forge in the San
>Francisco Bay area in FY2018, designed
>to accelerate our digital projects and
>provide a co-innovation space for us,
>our customers and other partners.
>We also held workshops throughout
>the year to drive innovative thinking,
>identify and develop solutions for future
>problems, and collaborate on forward
>thinking technologies

# Our People

## Artificial Intelligence Team

A dynamic group of scientists and engineers that applied their skills to the problems of 
modelling complex data coming from assets in the oil and gas industry.  For the details
on that team, click [here](@/teams/ai/index.md).

* statistical modelling
* state-based designs
* real time visualization
* physics-based models

## Hardware Team

Much of the digital technology at the Forge required a physical hardware component.  Whether
this was packaging and integration of sensors, custom data acquisition systems, PCBs or 
thermal management for embedded compute devices, this team handled it all, along with
testing and customer support.  For the details on the hardware team, click [here](@/teams/hardware/index.md).

* packaging
* thermal management
* ruggedization of sensitive electronics
* design for hazardous locations (hazloc)
* certifications
* testing
* manufacturing design
* schematic capture & pcb design (Altium)
* FPGA-based designs (Xylinx and Lattice ECP5)
* galvanically isolated data acquisition
* modular board design
* testing (functionality, EMI, EMC, etc)
* board bring up
* software and hardware testing, validation


## Software Team

The software team covered the full stack, starting at the device level in embedded devices, and 
provided the software technology to bring the data all the way to the cloud for analysis and
review in a standard web browser.  They also handled the automated build, regression testing,
software process, and general architecture of the products being developed at the Forge.
For details on the software team, click [here](@/teams/software/index.md)

* embedded
* user interface (web full stack)
* systems architecture
* high performance compute
* cybersecurity
* firmware
* bluetooth


## Program Team

The program team oversaw and ran dozens of complex projects, ranging from early stage research to
late stage product development and support.  They employed an Agile methodology and interfaced
to broader waterfall-style programs within the parent company as needed.  For more
details on the program team, click [here](@/teams/programs/index.md)

* agile program management
* project planning and execution
* sprint planning and reports
* customer stakeholder communication
* process development

## Leadership Team

The Forge leadership team have decades of experience in a wide range of technologies, including
explosives detection, RADAR signal processing, medical image reconstruction, enterprise level
networking, data analytics, and high performance compute.  The leadership team is described 
[here](@/teams/leaders/index.md)


* system architecture and deisgn
* manufacturing and fabrication of complex digital systems
* high speed processing
* cybersecure data transmission
* cloud infrastructure and design
* data analytics and algorithm

# Our Accomplishments

Much of what the Forge worked on remains proprietary to the parent company.  However, there are a couple of
projects that have a public presence, and we can provide some details on those.

## John Crane Sense

>John Crane’s long experience in preventing and 
>remediating leaks will enable us 
>to play a leading role in customer decarbonisation
>through our methane initiative.

>Methane is the most potent current
>contributor to global warming. With the oil
>& gas sector set to continue playing a key
>role in the energy supply chain, reducing
>methane emissions is a critical step
>towards Net Zero. Pursuing all mitigation
>measures now could slow the rate of near
>term global warming by as much as 30%,
>potentially reducing total warming by a half
>degree by the end of the century.
>Systematic measuring, mitigation and
>monitoring to limit methane emissions
>will be required by the sector to meet
>decarbonisation goals.
>
>Working with the Smiths *Digital Forge*,
>John Crane is developing technology and
>services to meet this need, which can be
>deployed across a range of environments
>from pipelines and plants to offshore rigs,
>in order to provide data to customers that
>will enable them to monitor methane leaks
>from sources over time and take corrective
>action. Multiple solutions are being
>developed to enable affordable technology
>and the ability to detect methane leaks in
>remote and hazardous locations.

>John Crane Sense™ is one example of
>the collaboration between the Digital
>Forge and John Crane.

>Sense is a platform utilising sensors
>and software that allow customers to
>optimise performance and improve
>reliability. Working with John Crane
>experts, the Digital Forge has
>developed sophisticated machine
>learning algorithms that monitor seal
>performance, diagnose root causes
>of equipment issues, and predict and
>prevent potential failures.

>John Crane experts build sensors into
>seals and integrate sensors with the
>surrounding equipment to capture
>critical data. The Digital Forge developed
>the technical infrastructure to move
>this data to a highly secure cloud-based
>server where it is processed using the
>latest algorithms and then stored for
>visualisation and continuous analysis
>over the life of the asset. Customers can
>also access all of their own unique
>information and gain valuable insights
>via this secure web browser based solution.

>Our innovation framework is enabling
>increased collaboration such as this
>across Smiths and extends to external
>partnerships. In FY2019 we entered
>into new partnerships with leading
>universities to help share ideas and
>create innovations for the future.
